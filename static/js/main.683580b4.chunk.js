These are highly broadband and omnidirectional, as well as thinner and lighter than human-made technologies. It is hypothesised that this performance can be explained by the structure of the moth\'s scales and hairs. These may form a \'metamaterial\' surface, whose sub-wavelength resonant structure slows down the propagation of sound and allows the material more time to absorb the incoming wave.","This project aimed to understand the metamaterial properties of moth wings through exploratory simulations. The finite-element method was used to model both traditional metasurfaces (composed of sub-wavelength Helmholtz-resonators), and moth wings. It is hoped that insights from the modelled acoustical phenomena can be used to design better human-made sound absorbers."]},{"title":"Spotting cracks in pipes with deep learning","image":"./assets/noun_Neural Network_873053.png","caption":"Neural Network by Knut M. Synstad from the Noun Project","description":["Ultrasound imaging is widely applied in mechanical engineering to examine components for defects. An image is typically formed by timing the echoes of an emitted sound wave using an array of sensors. The longer the length of time between the sound emission and subsequent echo, the further the defect is from the array. This approach is simple and relatively robust, but neglects the complex interactions between the sound wave and defect. The result is low levels of detail in the subsequent image.","Topological imaging works by using high-accuracy, detailed simulations of the wave propagation. These can provide a much higher level of detail, but certain artefacts limit the interpretability of these images. This project used deep learning techniques to better interpret the results of the wave simulations, and thus reduce subsequent artefacts in the reconstructed images."]},{"title":"Measuring corrosion damage in metal pipes","image":"./assets/corrosion_patch.png","description":["Metal pipes can be prone to corrosion when water becomes trapped near them. Common examples include the region between an above-ground pipe and its concrete supports, and in buried pipes. If the corrosion is severe enough, then the pipe will leak its contents. This can be extremely problematic from an environmental standpoint. However, it is also very difficult to inspect for corrosion, with many pipes being extremely long and likely corrosion locations often being hidden.","To perform such inspections ultrasound waves are useful. These can propagate over long distances, and images can be formed from discrepancies between the transmitted and received waves. In this project, I have developed imaging algorithms that can accurately determine not just the location of corrosion, but also its extent. This will allow managers to make informed decisions about when pipes need to be taken out of service and repaired or replaced."]},{"title":"Embedding sources in ultrasound simulations","image":"./assets/Offgrid_source.png","description":["To simulate ultrasound waves, regular computational grids are often used. This is effectively like storing an video as pixels, with each pixel giving the acoustic field at a given point in space and time. However, acoustic sources often don\'t lend themselves well to pixellation. For instance, the edges of a bowl-shaped transducer become staircased when represented on a grid. To combat this, I developed a technique for accurately representing a single point source at a location that is not aligned with the grid. This works by spreading the point source across many nearby pixels in an optimal manner. Arbitrary source distributions can then be accurately represented as collections of off-grid point sources."]},{"title":"Adapting computational meshes to shock waves","image":"./assets/Shock_wave_mesh.png","description":["Shock waves form when high-power sound waves propagate. A well-known example is a sonic boom, caused by aircraft travelling faster than the speed of sound in air. A lesser-known example is in medicine, where high-power ultrasonic waves are used to destroy unhealthy tissue. At the front of a shock wave, the acoustic pressure varies by a large amount over very little space. This is difficult to simulate, as the resolution of the simulation needs to be extremely high over this region. In this project, I developed tools for optimally determining an appropriate distribution of resolution, given limited computational resources. This was based on the local bandwidth of the wave-field, that is on the range of frequencies present at a given point in space."]},{"title":"What happened to AfterEllen.com?","image":"./assets/AfterEllen.jpg","description":["AfterEllen is a queer pop-culture news site. It was originally formed as an independent outlet for discussing the representation of queer women in entertainment, but was purchased by MTV in 2006. With new commercial interests, it seemed likely that the content of the site may have changed. To examine this, a large corpus of articles was scraped from the site and fed into a topic model. This model is able to distill each document into a set of representative topics, and each topic into a set of representative words. From this, trends in content can be seen over time. It was found that overtly political discussion had significantly lessened, in favour of superficial coverage of media."]},{"title":"Predicting erosion of ion thruster grids","image":"./assets/ion_thruster_sputtering.gif","description":["Ion thrusters are a form of spacecraft propulsion. They were notably used on the Deep Space 1 and Dawn spacecraft, but their main use is on satellites. This is because of their unrivalled fuel efficiency, providing decades of use with very little propellant mass.","Ion thrusters work by accelerating very small amounts of ionised gas up to extremely high velocities. However, these high-velocity particles cause damage to the thruster\'s components, and eventually flaking metal causes short circuits. These can cause the thruster to fail long before the propellant runs out. To combat this, I performed simulations of ion collisions with many different metallic crystals. This allows ion thruster designers to more wisely choose materials for their thruster components."]},{"title":"Compressing individual carbon fibres","image":"./assets/fibre_diagram.png","description":["Carbon fibre composites are widely used in the aerospace industry. These consist of a woven mat of fibres embedded in a resin. Their chief benefit over traditional materials is a high strength-to-weight ratio. However, this stength is highly directional. Carbon fibres are resistant to stretching, and resins to compression, but neither are resistant to bending. This can be determined through testing, but such tests slow down the development of novel composites.","To predict the bending stength of composites, we need the mechanical properties of their constituent parts. For carbon fibres, these properties are well-known in the longitudinal direction, but almost completely unknown in the transverse direction. This is because they are extremely small, making testing of an individual fibre difficult. In this project, colleagues developed a technique for measuring the miniscule transverse deformations of fibres under loading. To convert these deformations into material properties, I developed analytical and finite-element models of the deformation process."]},{"title":"Extracting lactoferrin from milk whey","image":"./assets/BLf_protein.png","description":["Lactoferrin is a protein that is found in milk. It can be used as a nutritional supplement in baby formula, as it has anti-microbial properties. This project developed a technology for efficiently extracting lactoferrin from milk whey. It works using stimuli-responsive polymer balls. When heated, polymer hairs on the surface of the balls extend into the milk whey, binding with the protein. The milk whey can then be washed away, and the temperature brought down again. As the temperature drops, the hairs retract and release the protein.","To design these polymers, two types of molecular dynamics simulations were used. First, the heat treatment process was simulated for the lactoferrin protein. This showed that certain binding sites became accessible when the protein was heated. Second, the interactions between these binding sites and a large number of polymers were simulated. Candidate polymers were then able to be tested in the lab so that the most effective could be used in the final product."]},{"title":"Axisymmetric ultrasound simulation","image":"./assets/axisymmetric_ultrasound.png","description":["Ultrasound plays an important role in medicine, with uses including imaging, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. This last application works by focussing high-power ultrasound waves onto a tumour, causing highly localised heating. Simulations are used to ensure that the sound waves focus as intended, and to determine the appropriate level of power that is applied. However, the high frequencies involved can make simulation prohibitively computationally expensive.","One way of mitigating these expenses is to exploit symmetry. Often, the ultrasound transducers are shaped like spherical bowls. The sound waves then have the same symmetry, and this can be exploited in the simulation, reducing a three-dimensional problem down to two-dimensions. To do so, discrete sine and cosine transforms are used. These represent the acoustic field in a using functions with certain symmetry properties.This brings computational costs down dramatically."]},{"title":"Watershed modelling in data-sparse regions","image":"./assets/noun_creek_22410.png","caption":"creek by Dan Hetteix from the Noun Project","description":["Models are routinely used to predict the flows of water within a catchment given rainfall data. Uses include managing land-use in agriculture, and reducing risks from flooding events. These models are typically calibrated from historical datasets that include rainfall measured throughout the catchment, and runoff in any nearby streams. However, this data takes large amounts of time and resources to collect.","To apply models to catchments that lack this data, we can use regionalisation. This relies on measuring other physical attributes of catchments, such as their topology and foliage cover. Such attributes are typically easier to source than rainfall-runoff data, especially as they vary little with time.An uncalibrated catchment can then use the parameters of calibrated catchments provided they share its physical attributes."]}]}')}},[[163,1,2]]]);
