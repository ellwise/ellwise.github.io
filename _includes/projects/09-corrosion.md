Metal pipes can be prone to corrosion when water becomes trapped near them. Common examples include the region between an above-ground pipe and its concrete supports, and in buried pipes. If the corrosion is severe enough, then the pipe will leak its contents. This can be extremely problematic from an environmental standpoint. However, it is also very difficult to inspect for corrosion, with many pipes being extremely long and likely corrosion locations often being hidden.

To perform such inspections ultrasound waves are useful. These can propagate over long distances, and images can be formed from discrepancies between the transmitted and received waves. In this project, I have developed imaging algorithms that can accurately determine not just the location of corrosion, but also its extent. This will allow managers to make informed decisions about when pipes need to be taken out of service and repaired or replaced.
