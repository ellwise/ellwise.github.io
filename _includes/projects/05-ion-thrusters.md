Ion thrusters are a form of spacecraft propulsion. They were notably used on the Deep Space 1 and Dawn spacecraft, but their main use is on satellites. This is because of their unrivalled fuel efficiency, providing decades of use with very little propellant mass.

Ion thrusters work by accelerating very small amounts of ionised gas up to extremely high velocities. However, these high-velocity particles cause damage to the thruster's components, and eventually flaking metal causes short circuits. These can cause the thruster to fail long before the propellant runs out. To combat this, I performed simulations of ion collisions with many different metallic crystals. This allows ion thruster designers to more wisely choose materials for their thruster components.
