To defend against predation by echolocating bats, moths have evolved acoustically absorbant wings. These are highly broadband and omnidirectional, as well as thinner and lighter than human-made technologies. It is hypothesised that this performance can be explained by the structure of the moth's scales and hairs. These may form a 'metamaterial' surface, whose sub-wavelength resonant structure slows down the propagation of sound and allows the material more time to absorb the incoming wave.

This project aimed to understand the metamaterial properties of moth wings through exploratory simulations. The finite-element method was used to model both traditional metasurfaces (composed of sub-wavelength Helmholtz-resonators), and moth wings. It is hoped that insights from the modelled acoustical phenomena can be used to design better human-made sound absorbers.
