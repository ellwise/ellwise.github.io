Models are routinely used to predict the flows of water within a catchment given rainfall data. Uses include managing land-use in agriculture, and reducing risks from flooding events. These models are typically calibrated from historical datasets that include rainfall measured throughout the catchment, and runoff in any nearby streams. However, this data takes large amounts of time and resources to collect.

To apply models to catchments that lack this data, we can use regionalisation. This relies on measuring other physical attributes of catchments, such as their topology and foliage cover. Such attributes are typically easier to source than rainfall-runoff data, especially as they vary little with time.An uncalibrated catchment can then use the parameters of calibrated catchments provided they share its physical attributes.
