Carbon fibre composites are widely used in the aerospace industry. These consist of a woven mat of fibres embedded in a resin. Their chief benefit over traditional materials is a high strength-to-weight ratio. However, this stength is highly directional. Carbon fibres are resistant to stretching, and resins to compression, but neither are resistant to bending. This can be determined through testing, but such tests slow down the development of novel composites.

To predict the bending stength of composites, we need the mechanical properties of their constituent parts. For carbon fibres, these properties are well-known in the longitudinal direction, but almost completely unknown in the transverse direction. This is because they are extremely small, making testing of an individual fibre difficult. In this project, colleagues developed a technique for measuring the miniscule transverse deformations of fibres under loading. To convert these deformations into material properties, I developed analytical and finite-element models of the deformation process.
