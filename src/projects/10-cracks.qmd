Ultrasound imaging is widely applied in mechanical engineering to examine components for defects. An image is typically formed by timing the echoes of an emitted sound wave using an array of sensors. The longer the length of time between the sound emission and subsequent echo, the further the defect is from the array. This approach is simple and relatively robust, but neglects the complex interactions between the sound wave and defect. The result is low levels of detail in the subsequent image.

Topological imaging works by using high-accuracy, detailed simulations of the wave propagation. These can provide a much higher level of detail, but certain artefacts limit the interpretability of these images. This project used deep learning techniques to better interpret the results of the wave simulations, and thus reduce subsequent artefacts in the reconstructed images.
