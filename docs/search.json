    "section": "",
    "text": "Ion thrusters work by accelerating very small amounts of ionised gas up to extremely high velocities. However, these high-velocity particles cause damage to the thruster’s components, and eventually flaking metal causes short circuits. These can cause the thruster to fail long before the propellant runs out. To combat this, I performed simulations of ion collisions with many different metallic crystals. This allows ion thruster designers to more wisely choose materials for their thruster components."

    "text": "AfterEllen is a queer pop-culture news site. It was originally formed as an independent outlet for discussing the representation of queer women in entertainment, but was purchased by MTV in 2006. With new commercial interests, it seemed likely that the content of the site may have changed. To examine this, a large corpus of articles was scraped from the site and fed into a topic model. This model is able to distill each document into a set of representative topics, and each topic into a set of representative words. From this, trends in content can be seen over time. It was found that overtly political discussion had significantly lessened, in favour of superficial coverage of media."

    "text": "To predict the bending stength of composites, we need the mechanical properties of their constituent parts. For carbon fibres, these properties are well-known in the longitudinal direction, but almost completely unknown in the transverse direction. This is because they are extremely small, making testing of an individual fibre difficult. In this project, colleagues developed a technique for measuring the miniscule transverse deformations of fibres under loading. To convert these deformations into material properties, I developed analytical and finite-element models of the deformation process."

This relies on measuring other physical attributes of catchments, such as their topology and foliage cover. Such attributes are typically easier to source than rainfall-runoff data, especially as they vary little with time.An uncalibrated catchment can then use the parameters of calibrated catchments provided they share its physical attributes."

    "text": "Shock waves form when high-power sound waves propagate. A well-known example is a sonic boom, caused by aircraft travelling faster than the speed of sound in air. A lesser-known example is in medicine, where high-power ultrasonic waves are used to destroy unhealthy tissue. At the front of a shock wave, the acoustic pressure varies by a large amount over very little space. This is difficult to simulate, as the resolution of the simulation needs to be extremely high over this region. In this project, I developed tools for optimally determining an appropriate distribution of resolution, given limited computational resources. This was based on the local bandwidth of the wave-field, that is on the range of frequencies present at a given point in space."

    "section": "",
    "text": "To simulate ultrasound waves, regular computational grids are often used. This is effectively like storing an video as pixels, with each pixel giving the acoustic field at a given point in space and time. However, acoustic sources often don’t lend themselves well to pixellation. For instance, the edges of a bowl-shaped transducer become staircased when represented on a grid. To combat this, I developed a technique for accurately representing a single point source at a location that is not aligned with the grid. This works by spreading the point source across many nearby pixels in an optimal manner. Arbitrary source distributions can then be accurately represented as collections of off-grid point sources."

The sound waves then have the same symmetry, and this can be exploited in the simulation, reducing a three-dimensional problem down to two-dimensions. To do so, discrete sine and cosine transforms are used. These represent the acoustic field in a using functions with certain symmetry properties.This brings computational costs down dramatically."

Candidate polymers were then able to be tested in the lab so that the most effective could be used in the final product."
