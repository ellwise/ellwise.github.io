While working within the data science and data engineerng spaces, I became familiar with Plotly Dash. This is a Python package that supports development of data-centric web applications. In building these applications, I found myself struggling to produce readable user-interface layout code.

Dash Compose is an open-source Python package I built that provides a tidier way of laying out Plotly Dash frontend components. It aims to both improve the readability of component trees and increase the locality of layout and logic.
