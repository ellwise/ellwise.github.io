Between my undergraduate and post-graduate studies, I undertook an independent research project in collaboration with a gender studies scholar, aiming to leverage my data science skills alongside her subject-matter expertise. This project examined the history and evolution of a website called AfterEllen.

AfterEllen is a queer pop-culture news site. It was originally formed as an independent outlet for discussing the representation of queer women in entertainment, but was purchased by MTV in 2006. With new commercial interests, it seemed likely that the content of the site may have changed. To examine this, a large corpus of articles was scraped from the site and fed into a topic model. This model is able to distill each document into a set of representative topics, and each topic into a set of representative words. From this, trends in content can be seen over time. It was found that overtly political discussion had significantly lessened, in favour of superficial coverage of media.
