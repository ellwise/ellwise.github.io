title: "Kedro Light: A Python package for rapid data pipeline formalisation"

While working within the data science and data engineerng spaces, I came to appreciate tooling for building data pipelines. I became familiar with a Python package called Kedro, but found it difficult to regularly put into practice on projects because it introduces some overhead and complexity into ways of working.

Aiming to lighten the Kedro experience for myself and others, I developed an open-source Python package called Kedro Light, which provides a minimal interface to Kedro and Kedro-Viz. It is intended for when you want to use Kedro's data catalog system and pipeline objects (to separate data from logic), as well as its visualisation capabilities, but don't want to embrace the full Kedro project structure and workflow.
