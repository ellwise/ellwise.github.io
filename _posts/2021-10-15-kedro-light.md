Kedro Light is a Python package I built that provides a minimal interface to Kedro and Kedro-Viz.
It is intended for when you want to use Kedro's data catalog system and pipeline objects (to separate data from logic), as well as its visualisation capabilities, but don't want to embrace the full Kedro project structure and workflow.
It was inspired by professional practice, and aims to lighten the Kedro experience for developers.

To read more about it, check out the documentation [here](https://wiseideas.au/kedro-light/).
