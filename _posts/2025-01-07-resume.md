## Education

__PhD__ | __Numerical Analysis__ | University College London | 2018  
__BEng (Hons)__ | __Mechatronics__ | Australian National University | 2012  
__BSc__ | __Mathematics__ | Australian National University  | 2012

* Expert in __applied mathematics__, __high-performance computing/simulation__, __acoustics__.
* Focus was on __scientific and industrial modelling__.
* Dean's Prize: Scholarship (Â£88,000), Faculty of Engineering, University College London.
* Summer Research Scholarship (AU$4,000), Math. Sci. Inst., Australian National University.

## Experience

__Senior Advisor__ | Gutteridge, Haskins & Davey (GHD) | 2021--Present

* __Data scientist__ and __simulation specialist__ within the __Insights & Analytics__ team.
* Clients construct and/or manage __large-scale public and private infrastructure__.
* Personal focus is on __building a new capability__ in the UK: The use of __dynamic simulation__ for __commercial analysis__ of large-scale infrastructure.
* Projects/clients have included:
    * __City of Toronto__: Development of a __techno-economic model__ of a proposed __renewable natural gas__ facility, capturing both the physical dynamics of the system and subsequent commercial performance. This is helping engineers to undertake __optioneering__ and provide financially justified technical advice.
    * __Central Government__: Development of a __dynamic simulation__ of border infrastructure and future configurations to inform a capability review against anticipated demand.
    * __Network Rail__: Development of a proof-of-concept __web-app__ to identify and communicate insights from network planning data. This helps users understand factors that have led to historical underperformance, and flags risks within upcoming work.
    * __National Highways__: Investigation into the factors holding back adoption of a new __enterprise data tool__. This included __conducting interviews__ with users, building out __training materials__, and __delivering workshops__.

__Senior Consultant__ | Amey Strategic Consulting | 2019--2021

* __Data scientist__ and __software engineer__ within the __Data Science & Analytics__ team.
* Clients were organisations involved in the management of public infrastructure, including __Kent County Council__, __Ofgem__, __Network Rail__, the __New York Metropolitan Transport Authority__, and the __Ferrovial Centre of Excellence for Asset Management__.
* Work included the development of __web apps__ for managing operations, developing and assuring new __regulatory policy__ addressing __risk management__ for large asset bases, data analysis through both classical __statistics and machine learning__, and the __simulation__ of operational systems of assets for __commercial analysis__.
* Work also included substantial elements of __management consulting__, including __stakeholder management__ and __leading workshops__.
* Tools included __Plotly Dash__, __React Bootstrap__, __Power BI__, __R-Shiny__, __PostgreSQL__, __VBA__, and __Power Query__.
* Techniques included __Causal Bayesian Networks__, __SHAP__ (explainable machine learning), __clustering__ (DBSCAN), and __topic modelling__ (latent dirichlet allocation).

__Research Associate__ | Imperial College London | 2018--2019

* Mathematician within the Non-Destructive Evaluation group, which develops __ultrasonic measurement__ techniques for detecting flaws in mechanical components.
* Development of __ultrasonic imaging algorithms__ for pipe inspections (corrosion in difficult-to-inspect locations). This included software development in __Matlab__, and the design of deep learning algorithms for image processing (a __convolutional autoencoder__ built with __Pytorch__).
* Simulation of __metamaterials__, a hypothesised mechanism for sound damping in moth wings that is thought to aid them in avoiding predation by echolocating bats (joint work with the Mathematics department).

__PhD Researcher__ | University College London | 2014--2018

* I was a member of the Biomedical Ultrasound Group, which develops new __ultrasonic therapies__ (e.g. __cancer ablation__, __neuro-stimulation__) and associated modelling and simulation tools. I also collaborated with computer science researchers at Brno University of Technology.
* I contributed to the development of the [_k_-Wave](http://www.k-wave.org/) __Matlab__ toolbox for medical ultrasound simulation. This has over __10,000 registered users__ and more than __700 citations__.
* My research included four projects, which tackled different aspects of the computational efficiency of the mathematics (__Fourier collocation__) underlying the toolbox's acoustic model.
* I authored __7 journal papers__ and __2 conference papers__ based on work conducted here.

__Mathematician__ | Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation | 2013--2014

* This is Australia's national science agency, whose chief role is to improve the economic and social performance of Australian industry.
* My role was within Mathematics, Statistics, and Informatics, primarily applying modelling and numerical simulations to __materials science__ problems, including:
    * Designing a polymer filter to bind and capture proteins for antimicrobial use. Involved __molecular dynamics__ and __metadynamics__ simulations (__NAMD__, __LAAMPS__).
    * Improving the lifespan of ion thrusters (a form of __spacecraft propulsion__) though better material choice informed by simulations of sputtering.
    * __Finite-element modelling (COMSOL)__ the transverse deformation in __carbon fibres__ to aid characterisation of elastic properties.
* I also collaborated with a gender studies scholar to investigate changes to the content of [AfterEllen](https://www.afterellen.com/) (a queer pop-culture news site) before and after its acquisition by MTV. This involved __web-scraping__ and __topic modelling__.

__Consultant__ | Eggler Consulting Engineers | 2010--2012

* Eggler Consulting Engineers provides __systems engineering__ management for military vehicle projects, as well as related __teaching services__ to both industry and academia.
* Worked as a consultant to __Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles__ on a response to a Defence tender for a fleet of modular logistics vehicles, and __prepared teaching materials__ for the Australian Defence Force Academy.
