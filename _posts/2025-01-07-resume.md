## Experience

**Senior Advisor** | Gutteridge, Haskins & Davey (GHD) | 2021--Present

- **Data scientist/engineer** and **simulation specialist** within the **Data & Insights** team.
- Clients construct and/or manage **large-scale public and private infrastructure**.
- Projects have spanned many infrastructure sectors: Energy, rail, telecommunications, farming, security.
- Leadership roles include **overseeing complex data engineering efforts** and supporting the **development of better working practices** internally and externally.
- Individual contributions have included the development of **simulation tools**, **dashboards**, and **data transformation pipelines**.
- Advisory roles have included **data strategy reviews**, **data architectures**, and change management during **digital system rollouts**.

**Senior Consultant** | Amey Strategic Consulting | 2019--2021

- **Data scientist** and **software engineer** within the **Data Science & Analytics** team.
- Clients were organisations involved in the management of public infrastructure, including **Kent County Council**, **Ofgem**, **Network Rail**, the **New York Metropolitan Transport Authority**, and the **Ferrovial Centre of Excellence for Asset Management**.
- Work included the development of **web apps** for managing operations, developing and assuring new **regulatory policy** addressing **risk management** for large asset bases, data analysis through both classical **statistics and machine learning**, and the **simulation** of operational systems of assets for **commercial analysis**.
- Work also included substantial elements of **management consulting**, including **stakeholder management** and **leading workshops**.

**Research Associate** | Imperial College London | 2018--2019

- Mathematician within the Non-Destructive Evaluation group, which develops **ultrasonic measurement** techniques for detecting flaws in mechanical components.
- Development of **ultrasonic imaging algorithms** for pipe inspections (corrosion in difficult-to-inspect locations). This included software development in **Matlab**, and the design of deep learning algorithms for image processing (a **convolutional autoencoder** built with **Pytorch**).
- Simulation of **metamaterials**, a hypothesised mechanism for sound damping in moth wings that is thought to aid them in avoiding predation by echolocating bats (joint work with the Mathematics department).

**PhD Researcher** | University College London | 2014--2018

- I was a member of the Biomedical Ultrasound Group, which develops new **ultrasonic therapies** (e.g. **cancer ablation**, **neuro-stimulation**) and associated modelling and simulation tools. I also collaborated with computer science researchers at Brno University of Technology.
- I contributed to the development of the [_k_-Wave](http://www.k-wave.org/) **Matlab** toolbox for medical ultrasound simulation. This has over **10,000 registered users** and more than **700 citations**.
- My research included four projects, which tackled different aspects of the computational efficiency of the mathematics (**Fourier collocation**) underlying the toolbox's acoustic model.
- I authored **7 journal papers** and **2 conference papers** based on work conducted here.

**Mathematician** | Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation | 2013--2014

- This is Australia's national science agency, whose chief role is to improve the economic and social performance of Australian industry.
- My role was within Mathematics, Statistics, and Informatics, primarily applying modelling and numerical simulations to **materials science** problems, including:
    - Designing a polymer filter to bind and capture proteins for antimicrobial use. Involved **molecular dynamics** and **metadynamics** simulations (**NAMD**, **LAAMPS**).
    - Improving the lifespan of ion thrusters (a form of **spacecraft propulsion**) though better material choice informed by simulations of sputtering.
    - **Finite-element modelling (COMSOL)** the transverse deformation in **carbon fibres** to aid characterisation of elastic properties.
- I also collaborated with a gender studies scholar to investigate changes to the content of [AfterEllen](https://www.afterellen.com/) (a queer pop-culture news site) before and after its acquisition by MTV. This involved **web-scraping** and **topic modelling**.

**Consultant** | Eggler Consulting Engineers | 2010--2012

- Eggler Consulting Engineers provides **systems engineering** management for military vehicle projects, as well as related **teaching services** to both industry and academia.
- Worked as a consultant to **Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles** on a response to a Defence tender for a fleet of modular logistics vehicles, and **prepared teaching materials** for the Australian Defence Force Academy.
